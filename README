A project to make a weird roguelike in Python using curses

Python's curses module: 
https://docs.python.org/howto/curses.html

Everyone is welcome to contribute. For the sake of preserving a modicum of sanity, this folder is a
git repo, so please use commits. Branches are also welcome.


A little bit of command-line git:
`git status` to see the current state of your working directory - red files are changed,
	green files are staged for commiting
`git diff` to review the changes you've made since the last commit and make sure they're what you want
`git add [filenames]` to stage files for your commit
`git add -p [filenames]` to stage only parts of files (which is a good way to break your commits into
	atomic pieces if you changed a bunch of stuff without committing)
`git commit` to prompt for a commit message and then commit added files

And if you want to fork the code, or just work on it in the relative safety of your home folder,
`git clone /home/Quarry/src/rockslike` (while you're in the parent folder of where you want the clone to go)
which will allow you to
`git pull` to get changes from the Quarry version
`git push` to copy your changes over to the Quarry version
I recommend you pull often and make small commits to avoid merge headaches.

`git help` and `git help [command]` will tell you more.
